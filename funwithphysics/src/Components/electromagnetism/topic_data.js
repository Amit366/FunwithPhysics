 details: `The electric field is defined mathematically as a vector field that associates to each point in space the (electrostatic or Coulomb) force per unit of charge exerted on an infinitesimal positive test charge at rest at that point.
 An electric potential (also called the electric field potential, potential drop or the electrostatic potential) is the amount of work needed to move a unit of charge from a reference point to a specific point inside the field without producing an acceleration`,
 formula: "e = f / q",
 process: `Electric potential is the work done or energy required to bring a unit charge from infinity to a point on the electric field without any acceleration being produced. `,

 si_units: "field:N/C,Volt/meter potential:j/c , volt",
