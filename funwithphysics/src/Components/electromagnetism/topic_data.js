    details: `The electric field is defined mathematically as a vector field that associates to each point in space the (electrostatic or Coulomb) force per unit of charge exerted on an infinitesimal positive test charge at rest at that point.`,
    formula: "e = f / q",
    process: `Electric field can be calculated by the force applied on the particle upon charge of the particle. `,
