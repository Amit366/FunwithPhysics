   Basic Physics Formulas	Concept	Formula
Average Speed Formula	It is used to calculate the average speed (S) of a moving body for the distance covered (D) as well as the time duration (T).	S = dt
Acceleration Formula	Acceleration refers to the rate of change in velocity to the change in time. It is denoted by symbol a.	a =v-ut
Density Formula 	This formula depicts the denseness of material in a specific given area.	P=mV
Power Formula	The capacity to perform an activity is known as Energy. On the other hand, energy spent in carrying out an activity (work) for a particular period of time is termed as Power.	P=Wt
Newton’s Second Law
Using the formula, the force can be expressed by the product of mass and acceleration of the body.	F = ma
Weight Formula
The formula measures the force with which an object falls due to gravity.	W=mg
Pressure Formula	Pressure refers to the amount of force applied per unit area of the object.	P=FA
Ohm’s Law Formula
Ohm’s law states that the current passing through a conductor material is directly proportional to the potential difference between two endpoints of the conductor.	V= I × R
Kinetic Energy Formula	Kinetic energy is the energy that is possessed by a body due to its state of motion.	E = 12mv²
Frequency Formula
Frequency refers to the revolutions completed per second or as the number of wave cycles.	F =vλ
Pendulum Formula	This equation calculates how long the pendulum takes swing back and forth in seconds	T = 2π√Lg
Fahrenheit Formula	This is a conversion formula for a temperature. 	F = (95× °C) + 32
Work Formula	The work formula measures the multiplication of magnitude of displacement d and the component of the force. 	W = F × d × cosθ
Torque Formula	Torque is rotational force or turning effect. It measures the magnitude of 	T = F × r × sinθ
Displacement Formula	Refers to the change in the object’s position from its initial place to its final position.	D = Xf–Xi = ΔX
Mass Formula	This formula represents the relationship between force and mass. Here, F = force, m = mass, and a = acceleration.	F = ma or m = F/m

SI Units
